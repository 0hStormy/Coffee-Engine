# Coffee Engine
Coffee Engine is a free and open source game engine made in javascript. Its goal is to be a usable and fun game engine!
## Quirks of the engine
The engine has some quirks while working on its source contributors might have to get used to.
### No JS packages
Despite being written in javascript no packages or modules are allowed to be used within the repository, besides ones for compiling the editor
### Node based before everything
The engine's new focus is to have a object management system similar to godot, but with the features of javascript and other contemporary engines.
### Cross Language Compatibility
Coffee Engine's language compatibility comes before anything else. Thus the reason everything compiles to javascript!
