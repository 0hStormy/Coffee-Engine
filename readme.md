# Coffee Engine

Coffee Engine is a free and open source game engine made in javascript. Its goal is to be a usable and fun game engine!

## Quirks of the engine

The engine has some quirks while working on its source contributors might have to get used to.

### No JS packages

Despite being written in javascript no packages or modules are allowed to be used within the repository, besides ones for compiling the editor

### Node based before everything

The engine's new focus is to have a node based object system, but with the simplicity to be easy for beginners.

### Cross Language Compatibility

Coffee Engine's language compatibility comes before anything else. Thus the reason everything compiles to javascript!

### Be Fun!

Throw in some fun little easter eggs. Just make sure if they are disruptive to make them togglable.

### Customizability is key

Coffee Engine should be a very customizable engine. With almost everything being able to be moved around or changed in some way.
